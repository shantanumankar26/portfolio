        <h1>Inventory Management System</h1>
        <p>Objective: To design an SQL database for efficient inventory tracking and automate reporting using Python scripts.</p>
        <p>Methods:</p>
        <p>Created an SQL schema to manage inventory data, including product ID, stock levels, supplier details, and reorder thresholds.</p>
        <p>Developed Python scripts to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from transactional logs into the database, ensuring real-time updates.</p>
        <p>Automated report generation for inventory status and low-stock alerts using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.</p>
        <p>Deliverables:</p>
        <p>Provided stakeholders with interactive reports and visualizations in Power BI, highlighting inventory trends and potential shortages.</p>
        <p>Implemented an alert system for replenishing low-stock items, reducing stockouts by 25%.</p>
        <p>Outcome: Enhanced SQL and Python scripting abilities while optimizing inventory management processes for operational efficiency.</p>
