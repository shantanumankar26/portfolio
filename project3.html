        <p>Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key attributes influencing customer segmentation, such as frequency of purchases and average transaction value.</p>
        <p>Applied K-means clustering in Python (scikit-learn) to group customers into segments based on their behavior.</p>
        <p>Deliverables:</p>
